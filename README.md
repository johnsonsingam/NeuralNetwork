Question 1. Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to fullname function that should return the (full name).Write function named “string_alternative” that return severy other char in the full_name string..
Answer.  We are using `first_name` and `last_name` to store two input strings from user and we have written a function called `fullname` that concatenates two strings using `+` operator and we are passing that result to `string_alternative` function that skips alternate character and gives the resultant output.

Question 2. Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output. Finally store the output in output.txt file.
Answer. we are using the open method to open input.txt file in read mode and output.txt in write method and we are iterating the data in `input.txt` file and calculate the frequency of each word using `frequencyOfWords` and storing it in a dictionary that we have initialized `wordStore`. Next we are using write method to write the result in `output.txt` file.

Question 3. Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
1) Nested Interactive loop.
2) List comprehensions
Answer. Here we are using list of map along with split method to get the list of integers in inches from the user and storing in `heights_inches` then we are using nested interactive loop method to convert that list of inches to centimeters by writing a function called 
`getHeightUsingLoop` and we have also used list comprehension to calculate the height in centimeters.
